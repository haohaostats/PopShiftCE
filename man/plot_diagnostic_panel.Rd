\title{Plot the complete 4-in-1 methodology and diagnostics panel}
\usage{
plot_diagnostic_panel(h0_results, alt_results, lookup)
}
\arguments{
\item{h0_results}{The full results data.frame from a null scenario (delta=0)
simulation, as returned by \code{simulate_trials_ce$results}.}

\item{alt_results}{The full results data.frame from an alternative scenario
(delta > 0), as returned by \code{simulate_trials_ce$results}.}

\item{lookup}{The CE lookup object returned by \code{build_ce_lookup()}.}
}
\value{
A composite ggplot object created by \code{patchwork}.
}
\description{
This function creates a 2x2 panel plot that visualizes the core mechanics
of the MC-CE method. It combines the three CE calibration plots (joint H0
distribution, e(t1), c(t1)) with the decision geometry under an alternative.

\dontrun{
  # Assuming `lookup`, `res0`, and `res1` have been generated:
  diagnostic_panel <- plot_diagnostic_panel(
    h0_results = res0$results,
    alt_results = res1$results,
    lookup = lookup
  )
  diagnostic_panel
}
